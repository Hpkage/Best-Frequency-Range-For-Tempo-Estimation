The goal of this project is to find the best range of frequencies, in Hertz, to improve the accuracy of estimating the tempo of a song using EEG data.

The data provided by Dr. Blair Kaneshiro are EEG responses called Naturalistic Music EEG
Dataset – Tempo (NMED-T). There were 20 participants ranging from 19-29 years old
averaging to about 23 years old. Each participant listened to 10 songs of varying
tempos. The songs range from 4:30 – 5:00 minutes in length where all but one song is in
English.

The data collected from this experiment was cleaned from noise and downsampled to
125 Hz using filtering techniques. All of the files will be available through Matlab.
